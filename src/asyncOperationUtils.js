// An asyncOperation is an object that tracks the status of some data that we fetch from
// somewhere or send to somewhere. Each asyncOperation represents
// a single 'dataset' (which, today, always means a single ajax request -- although that's
// not a fixed constraint), and they're stored in Redux under operation-specific keys.
//
// "read" and "write" operations are *slightly* different, but they work the same way.
//
// The asyncOperation tracks information about:
//  - Our last attempt to fetch or write the data
//  - Whether we have data from a prior successful attempt (for reads only)
//  - The action and params and such that were used to request the data
//
// This file includes standalone functions that transform asyncOperations when we
// begin, resolve, or reject requests. In general, only reducers should use these functions.


/**
 * asyncOperations were originally always treated as proper immutable objects, but for background refreshes
 * it doesn't make sense to create a new object unless the status is actually different somehow, because
 * the new object will cause any screens that select the asyncOperation to rerender.
 *
 * So this is an experiment in having the asyncOperation object be *semi*-immutable: it will only yield
 * a new object instance if there's a noteworthy change in status.
